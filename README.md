# YoloV8 Customer UI

YoloV8 Customer UI is a streamlined tool designed to help users validate and enhance AI models without dedicating extra time. The interface allows users, such as doctors and analysts, to review AI predictions effortlessly and provide feedback on the model's accuracy.

When using YoloV8 Customer UI, you simply input the AI's analysis into the system. You then decide whether the AI's prediction is correct or incorrect. If a prediction is incorrect, the data is automatically sent back for further training. This continuous feedback loop ensures that the AI model improves over time, all while you work.

The project is hosted on GitHub to maintain transparency and enable customization, allowing you to integrate and adjust the tool as needed. YoloV8 Customer UI makes it easier than ever to contribute to the refinement of AI models, enhancing their accuracy in real-world applications.

Below are two demonstration images of the UI:
